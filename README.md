Example of how I made responsive emails
This is an example of responsive email (template) I made

It's always a challenge for me to create responsive emails.

There is no perfect solution for adjusting the template to each mail operator. Each time I try to add opening and closing comments to each section to make sure not to lose any of the elements. When creating web pages, styles are always in a separate file, while when creating emails, everything must be compressed into one HTML code.

The big challenge is always adjusting to the screen size due to the constantly released new models with innovative screen resolution.

The template that you will see is an example of my care over the code and the organization of the code itself.
